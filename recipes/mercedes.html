    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        They have the name. They have the history. They had Ross Brawn.
         They had Michael Schumacher. What more could a new team trying 
         to catapult itself to the top of the tree need? Well, a fast car
          would've helped.

        Hamilton dominated the 2019 and 2020 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship,
         taking 22 wins across the two seasons, and tied the record for most 
         championships for a driver in F1 history, with seven. Bottas finished 
         second in those two seasons, also producing consistent results for the 
         German brand. Between 2019 and 2020, Mercedes won 28 races with Hamilton 
         and Valtteri Bottas.
