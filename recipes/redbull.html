    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Four consecutive world championships and some hefty financial backing have made
         Red Bull Racing a powerful addition to the formula one grid since its
          induction in 2005. The controversial move from energy drinks manufacturers
           Red Bull to purchase a racing team may not have won them many hearts
           but in the subsequent years, they have earned everyone's respect and 
           nowadays, fear.
